# Perl Regular Expressions

## Skills Exercises
1. Write a perl filter which reads from STDIN and only prints those lines containing a number.Recall that you can terminate input from the keyboard by using control-d. (Hint: You can start with the basic perl filter construct below)
<pre>
    while (<STDIN>) {
        #filter code here 
    }
</pre>
2. Extend the previous program to only print lines with a number greater or equal to 6000 or less than or equal to -6000. (Hint you dont need to consider two cases just ignore the + or - sign).

3. Modify the previous program to only print lines with a number greater than 6000 or less than -6000. (Hint you dont need to consider two cases just ignore the + or - sign).

4. Write a perl script that accepts 3 arguments on the command line: a file to read data from and 2 words. The script is going to print the data from the file to the screen replacing all instances of the first word with the second word.
5. Write a perl script which reads from STDIN and prints a count of how many lines either begin or end with abc. Recall that you can terminate input from the keyboard by using control-d.
